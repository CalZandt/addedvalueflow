# Added Value Flow

This project is a simple web application that provides a workflow for tmo technical support. It was developed by Cal Zandt using Bootstrap 5, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript.

## Features

- A list of workflow steps that can be checked off as they are completed.
- A 'Done' button that saves a representation of the call to local storage.
- All styles are done with Bootstrap classes as much as possible before custom CSS.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

Follow the workflow steps and check off each one as you complete it. When you're finished, click the 'Done' button to save a representation of the call.
